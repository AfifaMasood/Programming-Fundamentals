Task 1 [00] 
A bank charges $10 per month plus the following check fees for a commercial checking account: 
$.10 each for fewer than 20 checks 
$.08 each for 20–39 checks 
$.06 each for 40–59 checks 
$.04 each for 60 or more checks 
The bank also charges an extra $15 if the balance of the account falls below $400 (before any check fees are applied). Write a 
program that asks for the beginning balance and the number of checks written. Compute and display the bank’s service fees for the 
month.
1.Input the beginning balance from user
2.Input the check
3. If ( beginning balance < 400 && beginning balance >=0)
4.          If ( check < 20 )
                    fee = .10 * checks + 10 +15
            Else-If ( checks > = 20 && checks <= 39)
                    fee = .08 * checks + 10 + 15
            Else-If ( checks >=40 && checks <= 59)
                     fee = .06 * checks +10 +15
            Else-If (checks >=60)
                      fee = .04 * checks + 10 + 15
            
5.Else-if (beginning balance >= 400)
6.          If (checks < 20)
                      fee = .10 * checks + 10
            Else-if ( checks >=20 && checks <=39)
                      fee = .08 * checks +10
            Else-if (checks >=40 && checks <= 59)
                       fee = .06 * checks + 10
            Else-if ( checks >= 60 )
                       fee = .04 * checks + 10 
8. Else
            If ((beginning blance +10) < 0)
                   Print " the amount is overdrawn"

Task:2
Write a program that asks for the names of three runners and the time it took each of them to finish a race. The program should 
display who came in first, second, and third place.
Solution:
1.Input name of three runners from the user."runner1,runner2,runner3"
2. Input the time required to finish the race."t"     20min
3.If (runner1 took time < t)
                 if(runner2 took time < t)
                                  Print"runner1 is at first place"
                 Else
                                 Print"runner2 is at first place"
                                 Print "runner1 is at second place"
                                 Print " runner3 is at 3rd place"
4.Else-If (runner2 took time < t) 
                 If(runner3 took time < t)
                                Print " runner2 is at first place"
                 Else 
                                Print " runner3 is at first place"
                                Print " runner2 is at second place"

Task:3
Take n numbers from the user and determine that how many positive and negative integers were entered by the user.
Solution:
1.Input "n" numbers from the user.
2.count of +ve no.s = 0
3.count of +ve no.s = 0
4. i = 1
5. while ( i < = n)
                       input a no. from user
                       If (no. > 0)
                       count of +ve no.s = count of +ve no.s + 1
                       Else- If (no. < 0)
                       count of -ve no.s = count of -ve no.s + 1
End-if
6.Print "count of +ve no.s"
7.Print "count of -ve no.s"
8. Print " End of the programm"

Task 4:
Take a positive integer n from the user. Display all the divisors of n. 
1.Input a +ve integer 'n' from user
2. i = 1
3. for ( i < = n & n > 0)
                     If (n % i ==0)
                               Print "i"

4. Print " i "
5. Print " End of the programm"

Task 5:
Take n numbers from the user and determine their average.
1.Input "n" numbers from the user
2. i = 1
3. sum = 0
4. count of no. = 0
5. while ( i < = n)
                        input a no. from user
                        sum = sum + no
                        count of no. = count of no. + 1
                                i = i + 1
                         avg = sum / count of no.
