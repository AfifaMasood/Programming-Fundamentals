((°F - 32) x 5/9 = °C ) 
1.Input temperature in Fahrenheit"°F"
  //conversion of fahrenheit to celcius
2.Calculate temperature in celcius  °C = (°F - 32) x 5/9
3.Print °C (celcius temperature)



Question no (8):
Write a program that initializes three variables and displays z after computing it as (z=x+y) 
Solution:
1.Input three variables as x , y & z
  //Addition of two variables x & y
2.Calculate sum = x + y
3.Print output "z" as 'z = x + y'




Question no (9):
9. Write a program that evaluates the following expression: y=3b
Try to analyze which variable should be input. Note that 3b equals 3*b, so don’t miss understand.
Sollution:
1.input a variable "b"
  //multiply the variable with number 3
2.Calculate mult = 3 * b
3.Print output y as 'y = 3 * b'



Question no(10):
Write a program that inputs a number and displays its square. (Hint : y = x*x) 
Solution:
1.Input a number in x
  // multiply the number in x by itself
2.Calculate mult = x * x
3.Print output y as 'y = x*x'



Question no(11):
Write a program that evaluates the following expression : z=3x+y 
Solution:
1.Input three variables x , y & z
  //multiply 3 by x
2.Calculate mult = 3 * x
  //addition "mult with y"
3.Calculate sum = mult + y
4.Print output 'z' as z=3x+y 




Question no(12):
Write a program that evaluates the following expression : z=(x+y)/7 
Solution:
1.Input three variables as x , y & z
  //addition of x & y
2.Calculate sum = x + y
  //divide sum by 7
3.Calculate div = sum/7 or (x + y)/7
4. Print output 'z' as  z=(x+y)/7 




Question(13):
Write a program that evaluates the following expression : (3x+y)/(z+2)
(Hint: Try to solve it without involving any additional variable) 
Solution:
1.Input three variales as x , y & z
  //multiply 3 by variable x
2.Calculate mult = 3 * x
  //sum "mult" with variable y
3.Calculate sum1 = mult + y or
   sum1 = (3 * x )+ y
  //sum 2 with variable z
4.Calculate sum2 = z + 2
  //Divide sum1 with sum2
5.Calculate div = sum1/sum2 or
    div =(3x+y)/(z+2)
6.Print expression, (3x+y)/(z+2)




Question no(14):
Write a program that evaluates the following expression : (3x+z)/(y+(4*3))
Solution:
1.Input three variables as x , y & z
  //multiply 3 by x
2.Calculate mult1 = 3 * x
  //sum mult1 with z
3.Calculate sum1 = mult1 + z
  //multiply two numbers 4 & 3
4.Calculate mult2 = 4 * 3
  // sum mult2 with y
5.Calculate sum2 = mult2 + y
  //Divide sum1 by sum2
6.Calculate div = sum1/sum2 or
    div=(3x+z)/(y+(4*3))
7.Print expression, (3x+z)/(y+(4*3))




Question no(15):
15. Write a program that calculates and displays the Area of Rectangle. (How many variables should we need to
calculate Area?)
Solution:
1.Input width and length of rectangle
  //area = width * length
2.Calculate Area = length * width
3.Print area of rectangle





Question(16):
Write a program that inputs two variables, stores their sum in the first one and the difference in the second one.
And dry run your program to see if it works correctly. Also Draw an Execution Sheet on your Notebook to check whether your program works correctly or not.

Solution:
1.Input two variables as x & y
 //sum  two variables
2.Calculate sum = x + y
  //subtract two variables
3.Calculate sub = x - y
  //output x
4.Print output 'x' as 'x = x + y'
  //output y
5.Print output 'y' as 'y = x - y'
